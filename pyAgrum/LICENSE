The aGrUM/pyAgrum library and all its derivatives are distributed under the LGPLv3 license, see COPYING and COPYING.LESSER.
You can therefore integrate this library into your software solution but it will remain covered by the LGPL v.3 license. If you wish to 
integrate the aGrUM library into your product without being affected by the LGPL v.3, please contact us (info@agrum.org).

This library depends on different third-party codes. See src/aGrUM/tools/externals for specific COPYING and explicit permission of the authors, if needed.

If you use aGrUM/pyAgrum as a dependency of your own project, you are not contaminated by the GPL license of some of these third-party codes as long as you use only their aGrUM/pyAgrum interfaces and not their native interfaces.
